# Restaurant Clientele Prediction

This project is an modest attempt to predict the number of clients that will attend to a specific restaurant based on multiple variables of that day (whether, period of the year, menu and others) using neural networks. An database is required to train the neural network, so it can compute an estimate of the number of people that will attend.

## Project Details

We are using Python 3.x and the [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/) library.
